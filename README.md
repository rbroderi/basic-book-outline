# basic-book-outline
a latex book structure with the usual parts

The idea for this project is to help students, authors and other writers be able
to typeset a nice looking book with all the parts that go into a standard book.

Ultimately I would like to have key-value settings and other easy to configure
options to allow easier customization of the book.cls than is standard, and a
more uniform method than current latex package such as titlesec, tocsec. Etc. By
creating wrappers around these settings a unified API can be developed.
